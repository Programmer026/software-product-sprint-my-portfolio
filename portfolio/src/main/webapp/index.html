      <h1>Yemi's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p><i>My name is Oluwayemisi Runsewe, Yemi for short.<br>I am a rising Junior at Northwest Missouri state University with a major in Computer Science.
      <br>I love reading novels and watching movies. I am also a big fan of gaming, I can't say i am that great at it but i do enjoy it.</i></p>

      <h3><b>A little About Home</b></h3>
      <img src="imgDir/Africa.jpeg" alt="Nigeria in Africa" style="width:400px;height:400px;">
      <p>My home country is Nigeria. Nigeria is located around the equator thus the weather is always hot.<br>
          I came to the US in 2018 to study Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University.
          <br>I come from a family family of 5. I used to live with both parents and my older brother and sister untill i movedto the US for school
          <br><br>It was through my older brother that I got into Computer Science. I had originally wanted to be a pre-medical student
          <br>However i had opted to start with a CS degree which lead to me becoming a full Computer Science a major.
          <br>I love CS for so many reasons but the one one reason i love it most is the flexibility and freedom that comes with being in Technology field.

      <h6>Some Challenges/Stories About my Projects</h6>
      <ul>
          <li>While working on the hangman game in my repo, i have spent 6 hours trying to figure out why i was getting an error
          . I later found out I had an indentation error (Because Python is case sensitive), i was very frustrated but the joy i received afterwards was worth it</li>
          <li>I had started on the Cyclic voltammetry Project for my brother, in order to make is calculations faster for the experiments he carried on in his lab</li>
          <li>The Java-Quest game was my last project in Programming 2 class. I had spent 4 hours trying to figure out how to give the user option to choses a character.
              This was very important because the character the user chose determined the special ability of the player.
          </li>
